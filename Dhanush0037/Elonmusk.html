            <p>
                Space exploration is the use of astronomy and space technology to explore outer space. While the study of space is carried
                out mainly by astronomers with telescopes, its physical exploration though is conducted both by unmanned
                robotic space probes and human spaceflight.
            </p>
            <h2> Future Space:</h2>
            <p>
                Space Exploration Technologies Corp., trading as SpaceX, is a private American aerospace manufacturer and space transportation
                services company headquartered in Hawthorne, California. It was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk with the goal
                of reducing space transportation costs to enable the colonization of Mars.[7][8][9] SpaceX has developed
                several launch vehicles and the Dragon spacecraft. SpaceX's achievements include the first privately funded
                liquid-propellant rocket to reach orbit (Falcon 1 in 2008), the first private company to successfully launch,
                orbit, and recover a spacecraft (Dragon in 2010), the first private company to send a spacecraft to the International
                Space Station (Dragon in 2012),[11] the first propulsive landing for an orbital rocket (Falcon 9 in 2015),
                the first reuse of an orbital rocket (Falcon 9 in 2017), and the first private company to launch an object
                into orbit around the sun (Falcon Heavy's payload of a Tesla Roadster in 2018). SpaceX has flown 18 resupply
                missions to the International Space Station (ISS) under a partnership with NASA.[12] NASA also awarded SpaceX
                a further development contract in 2011 to develop and demonstrate a human-rated Dragon, which would be used
                to transport astronauts to the ISS and return them safely to Earth.[13] SpaceX conducted the maiden launch
                of its Dragon 2 spacecraft on a NASA-required demonstration flight (Crew Dragon Demo-1) on March 2, 2019
                and is set to launch its first crewed Dragon 2 on May 7, 2020.[14] In December 2015, a Falcon 9 accomplished
                a propulsive vertical landing. This was the first such achievement by a rocket for orbital spaceflight.[15]
                In April 2016, with the launch of CRS-8, SpaceX successfully vertically landed the first stage on an ocean
                drone ship landing platform.[16] In May 2016, in another first, SpaceX again landed the first stage, but
                during a significantly more energetic geostationary transfer orbit mission. In March 2017, SpaceX became
                the first to successfully re-launch and land the first stage of an orbital rocket.[18] In January 2020, with
                the third launch of the Starlink project, SpaceX became the largest commercial satellite constellation operator
                in the world. In September 2016, CEO Elon Musk unveiled the Interplanetary Transport System, a privately
                funded launch system to develop spaceflight technology for use in crewed interplanetary spaceflight. In 2018,
                Musk unveiled an updated configuration of the system, named Starship, which is planned to be fully reusable
                and will be the largest rocket ever on its debut, scheduled for the early 2020s.

            <h2>TESLA:</h2>
            <h3>Batteries:</h3>
            <p>
                Tesla Supercharger in West Hartford, Connecticut Unlike other automakers, Tesla does not use individual large battery cells,
                but thousands of small, cylindrical, lithium-ion commodity cells like those used in consumer electronics.
                Tesla's batteries are manufactured in Gigafactories, the name Gigafactory comes from the word 'Giga,' the
                unit of measurement representing “billions.” It uses a version of these cells that is designed to be cheaper
                to manufacture and lighter than standard cells by removing some safety features. According to Tesla, these
                features are redundant because of the advanced thermal management system and an intumescent chemical in the
                battery to prevent fires. Panasonic is the sole supplier of the cells for Model S, Model X, and Model 3 and
                cooperates with Tesla in the Giga Nevada's '21–70' cells. In February 2016, Tesla battery cell costs were
                estimated at US$200 per kWh. Tesla indicated later in 2016 that their battery cells cost less than $190/kWh.Still
                later that year Argonne Labs estimated $163/kWh at a production rate of 500,000 packs per year. In the 2018
                Tesla Shareholder meeting, Elon Musk stated battery cell cost could be $100/kWh in 2018. 2020 would bring
                $100/kWh Tesla battery packs (as opposed to battery cell). The batteries are placed under the vehicle floor.
                This saves interior and trunk (boot) space but increases the risk of battery damage by debris or impact.
                The Model S has 0.25 in (6.4 mm) aluminum-alloy armor plate. CTO Straubel expected batteries to last 10–15
                years,and discounts using electric cars to charge the grid (V2G) because the related battery wear outweighs
                economic benefit. He also prefers recycling over re-use for grid once they reach the end of their useful
                life for vehicles. Since 2008, Tesla has worked with ToxCo/Kinsbursky to recycle worn out RoHS batteries,
                which will be an integral part of all Gigafactories. Tesla has ongoing battery research and development work
                at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, Canada, featuring lead researcher Jeff Dahn.Tesla acquired two battery
                companies in 2019, Hibar Systems and Maxwell Technologies, all expected to play an important role in Tesla's
                battery strategy.</p>
            <h2>CYBER TRUCK</h2>
            <p>The Tesla Cybertruck is an all-electric, battery-powered, light commercial vehicle in development by Tesla, Inc.
                Three models have been announced, with range estimates of 250–500 miles (400–800 km) and an estimated 0–60
                mph time of 2.9–6.5 seconds, depending on the model. The stated goal of Tesla in developing the Cybertruck
                is to provide a sustainable-energy substitute for the roughly 6,500 fossil-fuel-powered trucks sold per day
                in the United States. The base price of the rear-wheel drive model of the vehicle will be US$39,900, with
                all-wheel drive models starting at $49,900. Cybertruck production is slated to begin in 2021, with more models
                being offered by 2022.</p>

            of the Uttar Pradesh U-16s and came to prominence amongst Indian selectors in 2002 when he was selected at the
            age of 15 and a half years for the U-19 tour to England, where he made a pair of half-centuries in the U-19 Test
            matches. He toured Sri Lanka later that year with the U-17 team. He made his Ranji Trophy debut for Uttar Pradesh
            against Assam in February 2003 at the age of 16 but did not play another match until the following season. In
            late 2003, he toured Pakistan for the U-19 Asian ODI Championship before being selected for the 2004 U-19 World
            Cup, where he scored three half-centuries, including a 90 scored off only 38 balls. He was then awarded a Border-Gavaskar
            scholarship to train at the Australian Cricket Academy and in early 2005, he made his first-class limited overs
            debut, and scored 645 runs that season at an average of 53.75. In 2017, Raina did not manage to remain a regular
            fixture in the Indian team and was dropped from the Annual Retainership of the BCCI.</p>
        <h2>Captaincy and 2011 West Indies tour</h2>

            Gambhir was ruled out, with Raina captaining with Harbhajan as his deputy. India won the series, but Raina averaged
            just 16.4. In the Test matches, he scored 232 runs at the average of 46.4 scoring crucial fifties in each Test.</p>
        <h2>Indian Premier League</h2>
        <p>Raina was signed by the Chennai Super Kings for US$650,000 for the first three years of the tournament. Raina made
            significant contributions in the first edition of the tournament to compensate the Chennai Super Kings over the
            losses of key players like Matthew Hayden, Michael Hussey and Jacob Oram. He played a vital Man of the Match
            performance in the last league fixture to give Chennai Super Kings the win they required to qualify for the semi-finals.
